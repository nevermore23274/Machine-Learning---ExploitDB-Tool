# Docker

- These commands are the simplest to get it built and running while using Docker on Windows:
```
docker build -t model:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run --name model -v "<drive:\location>:/home/testing/model" --gpus all -it model
```
- If you want to use CPU, just omit the GPU flag:
```
docker run --name model -v "<drive:\location>:/home/testing/model" -it model
```

# Podman

- These commands are the simplest to get it built and running while using Docker on Linux:
```
podman build -t model:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
podman run --name model -v <location>:/home/testing/model:z --gpus all -it model
```
- If you want to use CPU just omit the GPU flag:
```
podman run --name model -v <location>:/home/testing/model:z -it model
```

# Docker Edge Cases

- NOTE: If any folder in your pathing has spaces, ensure you place quotes around the -v command. This goes for all OS's. For example:
```
docker run --name model -v "C:\My Drive\<rest>:/home/testing/model" -t model
```

### Linux
```
docker build -t model:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
docker run --name model -v <location>:/home/testing/model -t model
```

- When coming back (the --name assigns a name to a container, so no need to do it again since you've already made the container)
```
docker run -v <location>:/home/testing/model -t model
```

- To clean up your system after you're done:
```
docker system prune --all
```

### Windows
```
docker build -t model:latest -f Docker/Dockerfile .
docker run --name model -v <drive>:<location>:/home/testing/model -t model
```

- When coming back (the --name assigns a name to a container, so no need to do it again since you've already made the container)
```
docker run -v <drive>:<location>:/home/testing/model -t model
```

- To clean up your system after you're done:
```
docker system prune --all
```

# Podman

If you've decided to use Podman, I've included these commands to help the process along.

### Linux
```
podman build -t model:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
podman run --name model -v <location>:/home/testing/model:z -t model
```

- When coming back (the --name assigns a name to a container, so no need to do it again since you've already made the container)
```
podman run -v <location>:/home/testing/model:z -t model
```

- To clean up your system after you're done:
```
podman system prune --all
```

### Windows
```
podman build -t model:latest -f Docker/Dockerfile .
podman run --name model -v <drive>:<location>:/home/testing/model -t model
```

- When coming back (the --name assigns a name to a container, so no need to do it again since you've already made the container)
```
podman run -v <drive>:<location>:/home/testing/model -t model
```
