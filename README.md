# Machine Learning - ExploitDB Tool

- See [here](https://github.com/nevermore23274/Machine-Learning-ExploitDB-Tool/blob/main/docker/DockerCommands.md) for Docker/Podman commands for the model.

- For building the training tools you should just need to run this from the docker folder:
```
docker-compose up training
```
- Then:
```
docker-compose run development
```
- You can then see any generated images in the new "images" folder created.

- When inside the development environment, to run the model just use:
```
python main.py
```
